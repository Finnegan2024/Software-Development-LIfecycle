#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs will typically come in some sort of feature or function that the user or business wants/needs. We can then further break down these needs into user stories with acceptance criteria to turn them from an idea to an implemented feature. The acceptance criteria helps us determine a sense of what the user story needs to accomplish/how it should react to input. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Agile have proven to be beneficial and has grown in populatiry as a result. It allows us to achieve results and feedback extremely quickly which helps our stakeholders determine what course the product is taking and to invoke change when needed. Agile leverages change with its flexible methodology which is a key componenet to the software industry. As changes are inevitable, developers can achieve small releaseable iterations of the application to assist in determining where the application should go or what to include.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is someone who takes ownership of their work, strives for transparency, and is an effective communciator. All three of these qualities can be acheived and they can help any person integrate well with a new or existing team. Agile strives for ownership to facilate a self-organzing team. A self-organziing team also depends on transparency of the work done and to be done, and this can only be acheived when there are open and clear communication lines between team members.
